Galleria Holdings is a fast-food chain, which originated in Italy and has expanded to the UK.
Galleria Holdings has found that revenue has reduced. The company believes that the menus are too large and inconsistent across the outlets they have acquired. Galleria would like to change the menus based on changing consumer tastes and to reduce food wastage and thereby increase revenue. 

To achieve this, the company has asked the data engineer team to create a data warehouse for Business Intelligence.
